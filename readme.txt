== Description ==

This theme is derived from the Twenty Twenty-Three theme by the wordpress.org team.  I claim no ownership there of, however I am probably responsible for any issues.

Regarding the Twenty Twenty-Three theme - the wordpress.org team describes it this way:  The theme is designed to take advantage of the new design tools introduced in WordPress 6.1. With a clean, blank base as a starting point, this default theme includes ten diverse style variations created by members of the WordPress community.

Whether you want to build a complex or incredibly simple website, you can do it quickly and intuitively through the bundled styles or dive into creation and full customization yourself.
